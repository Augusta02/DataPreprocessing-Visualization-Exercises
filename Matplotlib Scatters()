# using simple scatter plots

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# .plot() is preferrably used when you don't need to distinguish the markers.
plt.plot([1,2,3,4],[10,4,6,7], "bo")
# 'bo' in the above arguements is used to distinguish the type of colour to be used for the dots or points on the graph
plt.show()
